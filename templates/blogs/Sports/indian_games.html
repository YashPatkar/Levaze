  <h2>1. Kho Kho:</h2>
  <p>
    Kho Kho is a traditional Indian sport that dates back over 2,000 years and
    is one of the most popular indigenous sports in the country. The game is
    played between two teams of 12 players each, with the objective being for
    one team to tag as many players on the opposing team as possible within a
    specified time limit. The twist? The chasing team must do so without
    crossing a line in the center of the field, while the defending team tries
    to avoid being tagged.

  <h2>2. Kabaddi:</h2>
  <p>
    Kabaddi is another ancient Indian sport that has been played for centuries
    and is immensely popular across the country. The game is played between two
    teams of seven players each, who take turns sending a "raider" into the
    opposing team's half to tag as many opponents as possible before returning
    to their own half. The raider must do so while holding their breath and
    chanting "kabaddi, kabaddi" to prove they haven't taken a breath. Kabaddi is
    known for its fast-paced action, strategic gameplay, and physicality.

  <h2>3. Mallakhamb:</h2>
  <p>
    Mallakhamb is a traditional Indian sport that combines elements of
    gymnastics, yoga, and wrestling. The sport involves performing acrobatic and
    gymnastic feats on a vertical wooden pole or rope. Mallakhamb requires
    incredible strength, balance, and flexibility, as athletes perform
    gravity-defying stunts and poses high above the ground. The sport has its
    roots in ancient Indian martial arts and has been practiced for centuries as
    a form of physical and mental conditioning.

  <h2>4. Gilli-Danda:</h2>
  <p>
    Gilli-Danda is a traditional Indian game that is similar to baseball or
    cricket but is played with a wooden stick (gilli) and a smaller stick
    (danda). The objective of the game is for one player to hit the gilli with
    the danda as far as possible, while the other players try to catch it or
    retrieve it before it hits the ground. Gilli-Danda requires precision,
    timing, and hand-eye coordination, and is a favorite pastime in rural areas
    across India.

    on a cross-shaped board with 29 intersections, and each player controls four
    pieces that they move around the board according to the roll of dice. The
