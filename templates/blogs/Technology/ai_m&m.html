  <h2>Genesis of Genius</h2>
  <p>
    The quest to replicate human intelligence began with simple curiosity and
    has now ballooned into a multifaceted field that touches every aspect of our
    lives. Early AI researchers could scarcely have imagined the breadth of
    their creation's potential, as AI now forecasts weather, powers virtual
    assistants, and even crafts art that rivals human creativity.
  </p>

  <h2>Learning to Learn</h2>
  <p>
    At the heart of modern AI is machine learning (ML), a subset of AI that
    enables computers to learn from data and improve over time. ML algorithms
    have been the cornerstone of recent AI breakthroughs, allowing systems to
    recognize patterns, make decisions, and predict outcomes with astonishing
    accuracy.
  </p>

  <h2>Ethical Algorithms</h2>
  <p>
    As AI continues to evolve, it raises profound ethical questions. How do we
    ensure AI systems are fair and unbiased? What measures can we take to
    safeguard privacy in an age of data-driven decision-making? “Mind and
    Machine” will explore these dilemmas, seeking to balance the scales between
    technological advancement and ethical responsibility.
